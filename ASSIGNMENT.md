# MLOps Experimental Learning Assignment: End-to-End ML Model Development, CI/CD, and Production Deployment

**Course Code:** MLOps (S2-25_AMLCSZG523)  
**Institution:** BITS Pilani (Pilani | Dubai | Goa | Hyderabad)  
**Total Marks:** 50

---

## 1. Objective
Design, develop, and deploy a scalable and reproducible machine learning solution utilizing modern MLOps best practices. The assignment emphasizes practical automation, experiment tracking, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, cloud deployment, and monitoring—mirroring real-world production scenarios.

## 2. Dataset
* **Title:** Heart Disease UCI Dataset
* **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
* **Description:** CSV containing 14+ features (age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.) and a binary target (presence/absence of heart disease).

## 3. Problem Statement
Build a machine learning classifier to predict the risk of heart disease based on patient health data, and deploy the solution as a cloud-ready, monitored API.

## 4. Assignment Tasks

### 1. Data Acquisition & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) [5 marks]
* Obtain the dataset (provide download script or instructions).
* Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode features).
* Perform EDA with professional visualizations (histograms, correlation heatmaps, class balance).

### 2. Feature Engineering & Model Development [8 marks]
* Prepare the final ML features (scaling and encoding).
* Build and train at least two classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression and Random Forest).
* Document model selection and tuning process.
* Evaluate using cross-validation and relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC).

### 3. Experiment Tracking [5 marks]
* Integrate MLflow (or a similar tool) for experiment tracking.
* Log parameters, metrics, artifacts, and plots for all runs.

### 4. Model Packaging & Reproducibility [7 marks]
* Save the final model in a reusable format (e.g., MLflow, pickle, ONNX).
* Write a clean `requirements.txt` (or Conda env file).
* Provide a preprocessing pipeline/transformers to ensure full reproducibility.

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline & Automated Testing [8 marks]
* Write unit tests for data processing and model code (Pytest or unit test).
* Create a GitHub Actions (or Jenkins) pipeline that includes Linting, unit testing, and model training steps.
* Include artifacts/logging for each workflow run.

### 6. Model Containerization [5 marks]
* Build a Docker container for the model-serving API (Flask or FastAPI is recommended).
* Expose `/predict` endpoint, accept JSON input, return prediction and confidence.
* The container must be built and run locally with sample input.

### 7. Production Deployment [7 marks]
* Deploy the Dockerized API to a public cloud or local Kubernetes (GKE, EKS, AKS, or Minikube/Docker Desktop).
* Use a deployment manifest or Helm chart.
* Expose via Load Balancer or Ingress.
* Verify endpoints and provide deployment screenshots.

### 8. Monitoring & Logging [3 marks]
* Integrate logging of API requests.
* Demonstrate simple monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana or API metrics/logs dashboard).

### 9. Documentation & Reporting [2 marks]
Submit a professional Markdown or PDF report including:
* Setup/install instructions.
* EDA and modelling choices.
* Experiment tracking summary.
* Architecture diagram.
* CI/CD and deployment workflow screenshots.
* Link to code repository.

## 5. Deliverables
1.  **GitHub repository** with:
    * Code, Dockerfile(s), `requirements.txt`/`env.yml`.
    * Cleaned dataset and download script/instructions.
    * Jupyter notebooks/scripts (EDA, training, inference).
    * Test folder with unit tests.
    * GitHub Actions workflow YAML (or Jenkinsfile).
    * Deployment manifests/Helm charts.
    * Screenshot folder for reporting.
2.  **Final written report** (10 pages) as a `.doc`/`.docx` file.
3.  **Short video** containing an end-to-end pipeline.
4.  **Deployed API URL** (if public) or access instructions (for local testing).

## 6. Production-Readiness Requirements
* All scripts must execute from a clean setup using the requirements file.
* Model must serve correctly in an isolated environment (Docker; container build/test proof required).
* Pipeline must fail on code or test errors and give clear logs.
